# drone

## Goals
My goals functionally for drone are:

 - Authenticate via github
 - choose interested repos
 - view aggregated open issue/pull request list
 - be able to filter labels, sort by date opened, last activity etc
 - be able to push issues into a queue

Once that MVP is done will look what is next, including automatically performing some tasks and trying to add some smarts to drone to reduce workload on OSS maintainers who have multiple projects.

My second goal is to use it as an opportunity to have a decent OSS isomorphic react sample where I can get feedback/ideas from others on a real codebase.

Pull requests with suggestions and next steps **really** welcome..
